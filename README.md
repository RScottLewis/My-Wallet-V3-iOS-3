# Tooling

Homebrew: 3.4.1+
Xcode: 13.2.1+
Ruby: 2.6.9
Ruby-Gems: 3.0.3
Swiftlint: 0.46.5+
Swiftformat: 0.49.5+

If you are using a M1 you might need to update ruby to version 2.7.5 or 3.x.x. Postponing the upgrade now so we don't disturb the current builds until the CI is updated to M1 and everybody get their M1s.


# Building

## Install Xcode

After installing Xcode, open it to begin the Command Line Tools installation. After finished, make sure that a valid CL Tool version is selected in `Xcode > Preferences > Locations > Command Line Tools`.

## Install Git submodules

    $ git submodule update --init

If the submodules are not fetched, run:

    $ git submodule update --recursive --force

### If you don't have read access to My-Wallet-V3-Private:

Open .gitmodules and modify My-Wallet-V3 entry url to the public repo:

`.gitmodules` from:
```
[submodule "Submodules/My-Wallet-V3"]
    path = Submodules/My-Wallet-V3
    url = git@github.com:blockchain/My-Wallet-V3-Private.git
    ignore = dirty
```
to:
```
[submodule "Submodules/My-Wallet-V3"]
    path = Submodules/My-Wallet-V3
    url = git@github.com:blockchain/My-Wallet-V3.git
    ignore = dirty
```

Then run:

    $ git submodule sync
    $ git submodule update --init

## Install `homebrew`

https://brew.sh/

## Install Ruby dependencies

Install a Ruby version manager such as [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

    $ brew update && brew install rbenv
    $ rbenv init

Install a recent ruby version:

    $ rbenv install 2.6.9
    $ rbenv global 2.6.9
    $ eval "$(rbenv init -)"
    
For M1 use this:
    $ rbenv install 2.7.6
    $ rbenv global 2.7.6
    $ eval "$(rbenv init -)"

Then the project ruby dependencies (`fastlane`, etc.):

    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle install

## Install build dependencies (brew)

    $ sh scripts/install-brew-dependencies.sh

## Install JS Dependencies

You will be installing:
    - [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git)
    - [node](https://nodejs.org/)
    - [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)

### Install nvm and Node

Check [nvm installaton instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

    $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

Install the correct node version:

    $ nvm install 8.17.0
    $ nvm use 8.17.0

If nvm is failing to install, please make sure you are installing it with the curl command above. If it still fails, check their website for a possibly newer installer.

### Install Yarn
    $ brew install yarn

### Checkout ios branch from Submodules/My-Wallet-V3
    $ cd Submodules/My-Wallet-V3
    $ git checkout ios
    $ cd ../..

### Install and build js files
    $ sh scripts/install-js.sh && sh scripts/build-js.sh

If the above command is failing you might need to fix the missing python binary on systems with python3 installed.

#### Install python3 using homebrew:

    $ brew install python3

You should see those Caveats at the end of a successful installation:

```console
==> Caveats
Python has been installed as
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin
```

The first lines tells us python3 binary was installed.

The second part tells us that there are unversioned aliases also installed in another directory that is not in our PATH but we can add to it if we want to make those unversioned aliases available.

To do so, edit your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` depending on which shell do you use. 
Find a line that starts with `export PATH` and add the aliases path to it.
Example below:

```console
BREW_PYTHON="$(brew --prefix python3)/libexec/bin"
export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$BREW_PYTHON:$PATH
```

## Prepare OpenSSL

    $ cd ./Submodules/OpenSSL-for-iPhone
    $ ./build-libssl.sh --cleanup --archs="x86_64 arm64"

## Add production Config file

Clone the [wallet-ios-credentials](https://github.com/blockchain/wallet-ios-credentials) repository and copy it's `Config` directory to this project root directory, it contains a `.xcconfig` for each environment:

```
Config/BlockchainConfig/Dev.xcconfig
Config/BlockchainConfig/Production.xcconfig
Config/BlockchainConfig/Staging.xcconfig
Config/BlockchainConfig/Alpha.xcconfig
Config/NetworkKitConfig/Dev.xcconfig
Config/NetworkKitConfig/Production.xcconfig
Config/NetworkKitConfig/Staging.xcconfig
Config/NetworkKitConfig/Alpha.xcconfig
```

For example, This is how `BlockchainConfig/Production.xcconfig` looks like:

```
ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIcon
OPENSSL_CERT_URL = blockchain.info
```

For example, This is how `NetworkKitConfig/Production.xcconfig` looks like:

```
API_URL = api.blockchain.info
BUY_WEBVIEW_URL = blockchain.info/wallet/#/intermediate
COINIFY_URL = app-api.coinify.com
EXCHANGE_URL = exchange.blockchain.com
EXPLORER_SERVER = blockchain.com
RETAIL_CORE_SOCKET_URL = ws.blockchain.info/nabu-gateway/markets/quotes
RETAIL_CORE_URL = api.blockchain.info/nabu-gateway
WALLET_SERVER = blockchain.info
WALLET_HELPER = wallet-helper.blockchain.info/wallet-helper
```

## Add Firebase Config Files

Clone `wallet-ios-credentials` repository and copy it's `Firebase` directory into `Blockchain` directory, it contains a `GoogleService-Info.plist` for each environment.

```
Firebase/Dev/GoogleService-Info.plist
Firebase/Prod/GoogleService-Info.plist
Firebase/Staging/GoogleService-Info.plist
Firebase/Alpha/GoogleService-Info.plist
```

## Add environment variables for scripts

Clone `wallet-ios-credentials` repository and copy the `env` to the root folder of the project, hide the file by using `mv env .env`

## XcodeGen

We are integrating XcodeGen and, despite still committing project files in git, we should generate project files using the following script:

### Installing:

    $ brew install xcodegen

## Generate projects & dependencies: 

    $ sh scripts/bootstrap.sh

üëâ Beware that this will take a while. Feel free to read some docs, a üìñ, get a ‚òï, or go for a üö∂ while it runs‚Ä¶

‚ö†Ô∏è You may need to run the following command if you encounter an `xcode-select` error:

    $ sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

## Build the project

    cmd-r

# Modules

Please refer to the [README](./Modules/README.md) in the `Modules` directory.
